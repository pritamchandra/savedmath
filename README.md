**A particular sequence of continuous functions:** Does there exist a sequence of continuous functions on [0, 1] such that it diverges everywhere but the corresponding integrals go to zero. 

**On counting special basis of R^3:** Counting the number of basis sets of R^3 whose vectors are made only of 0s and 1s.

**Open cover around rationals:** Finding enumerations {q_n} of the rational numbers such that the family of sets {q_n - 1/n, q_n + 1/n} covers or doesn't cover the whole real line.
